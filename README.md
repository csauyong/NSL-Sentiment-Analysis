# NSL-Sentiment-Analysis
Repository for storing files related to the project on analysing tweets regarding the implementation of National Security Law in Hong Kong.

In 2020, the National Security Law was implemented in Hong Kong, imposing harsh penalties to the communist partyâ€™s dissidents and gives the authorities extensive power to target activists who support Hong Kong's independence and pro democracy protests. This project aims to discover people's feelings towards this by analysing the tweets posted regarding the law.
