# NSL-Sentiment-Analysis
Repository for storing files related to the project on analysing tweets regarding the implementation of National Security Law in Hong Kong.

On 30 June 2020, the National Security Law was enacted in Hong Kong, imposing harsh penalties to the communist party’s dissidents and gives the authorities extensive power to target activists who support Hong Kong's independence and pro democracy protests. This project aims to discover people's feelings towards this by analysing the tweets posted regarding the law.

Core question: How does people feel about the Law?

## Methodology
Facing unlabelled data, I chose to adopt SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from Vader. Then, I analysed the change of sentiment and the overall sentiment by plotting, assuming the classification result is correct.
